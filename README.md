##### About
This is a work-in-progress recreation of the classic Oregon Trail Game made using JavaFX.
In this recreation, you can buy supplies for your trip and encounter random events on the trail.
In this current version most of the mechanics have been implemented but there is some missing such as the Hunting mechanic.

##### To Do:
- Add more events
- Implement a PlayerScore, player earns points throughout the game
- Display player stats at the end of the game
- Add in sounds and music

##### Credits
Original Oregon Trail creators: Don Rawitsch, Bill Heinemann, and Paul Dillenberge
